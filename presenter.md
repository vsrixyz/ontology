# Discovery

## Collecting the elements

Collect all the concepts that need definition in a a single place. Features that need names, language that's unclear, or anything else that's confusing.

## Start here

1. Create a board in Miro, Figjam, or any other [[collaborative whiteboard software]]. Or use this Figjam template.
2. Identify the participants and name a single decision maker for the Mapping, Narrative, and Terminology phases. (The content designer is generally the decision maker for Terminology.)
3. Spend 3 days adding post-it notes the board by answering the *kickstart questions*. (This can be done asynchronously.)

---

## Kickstart questions

- Who needs to be involved at each phase? More isn't always better. Also, name a sole decision maker for each phase. This person unblocks impasses.
- Spend 10 minutes and create a post-it for the key concepts of your experience. Think nouns. What do people touch, see, interact with? Limit one idea per post-it.
- Spend 10 more minutes but this time think verbs. What are people doing or trying to do? One idea per post-it.
- Spend 10 more minutes sorting. Which concepts are potentially confusing? Copy the post-its into one (or more) of the three types of confusing concepts.

## Three types of confusing concepts

| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collision    | When the same terminology is used for two concepts                                                                                                                                                       | `Huddle` has a specific meaning in Slack. If you called another feature "Huddle" that would be confusing.                                                                                                                               |
| Fuzzy label  | The reverse of collision. Where the same concept is referred to in multiple ways.                                                                                                                        | This is common. In Zendesk, a `ticket comment` is also referred to as a `reply` or a `message`.                                                                                                                                         |
| Dirty magnet | A kind of fuzzy label. It generally means a design element or feature that tends to attract mess or clutter over time, due to a lack of constraints or guidance on how to organize information properly. | Terms like `AI` and`machine learning` are being overused without being properly defined. <br><br>In the UI sense, a desktop or home screen without predefined structures where users indiscriminately place files, leading to disarray. |

## Concepts vs terminology

At this stage of the process, we are focusing on concepts, not terminology. Don't worry if the current label doesn't sit well with you. You will have a chance to change it later.

| Concept                | Terminology    | Branded terminology        |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| The idea, the meaning  | The label      | The brand or catchphrase   |
| Conceptual             | Functional     | Perceptual                 |
| *Homo Sapiens Sapiens* | George Clooney | "World's Sexiest Man 1997" |
| Text editor            | Composer       | RoboComposer               |

Sometimes the concept and terminology end up being the same, but they don't have to be.

## Things to avoid

- Don't do a full audit of the product. Focus on the concepts that are most confusing.
- Don't erase anything or santitize your boards. It's a kitchen sink, it's meant to be messy!
- Don't worry about knowing the answers; this is about generating questions and finding your blind spots.

# Concept mapping

## Painting a picture

Visually arrange your concepts to show how they are connected. There are lots of ways to do this, but try to keep it *low-fidelity* and simple.

---

## Start here

1. In another part of your whiteboard, answer the *clustering questions* to generate fodder for your concept maps.
2. Choose a concept map type and start arranging your clusters. (You can change your mind later, or you can make multiple maps.)
3. Draw arrows, group concepts, and annotate relationships. It's OK to be messy at first.

---

## Clustering questions

1. What concepts (verbs, nouns) etc go together? Move these together into clusters.
2. Physically separate unrelated clusters.
3. See if you can label clusters by theme or by *jobs to be done*.
